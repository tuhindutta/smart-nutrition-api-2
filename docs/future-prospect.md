# Future Prospects & To-Do Document to create a AI powered Nutrition guide app

## Project Vision

Develop a full-fledged software application with a user-friendly UI that integrates the **Smart Nutrition API** and the **Nutriguide API** to provide **customized nutritional guidance** for users. The system should allow users to add/remove food products (via image upload or manual entry), analyze their nutritional values, and receive personalized recommendations through a chatbot powered by LLM.

## To-Do Items

### Reference:

2. [Nutriguide API](https://techtrail.tuhindutta.com/testing-the-nutriguide-api)

### 1. Product Management

**Objective:** Allow users to seamlessly manage their product list by adding, editing, or removing items through images or manual input.

* Enable users to **add products** via two methods:

  * Image upload → process with OCR → fetch brand/product name using **`product-name` endpoint** (Smart Nutrition API).
  * Manual entry → user types in product names (e.g., butter, cheese, fruits).
* Allow users to **remove products** from their list.
* Maintain a dynamic product list for each user session.
* Add functionality to edit/update product details.
* Enable bulk product upload for efficiency.

### 2. Nutrition Data Fetching

**Objective:** Provide users with detailed nutritional information for each product and highlight important dietary factors.

* Use **`nutrition` endpoint** (Smart Nutrition API) to fetch nutritional values for all listed products.
* Standardize and store nutrition data in **JSON/JSONL format**.
* Display nutritional breakdowns in the UI (per product and aggregated view).
* Implement nutrition comparison charts across products.
* Add feature to highlight “red flag” nutrients (e.g., high sodium, saturated fat).

### 3. Health Profile Input

**Objective:** Capture user health conditions and dietary preferences to personalize recommendations.

* Provide form/UI for users to input:

  * Health conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes)
  * Dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, low-carb)
* Pass this data to **`health` endpoint** (Nutriguide API).
* Allow users to update health profiles over time.
* Add option to store multiple health profiles (e.g., family members).

### 4. Customized Nutritional Guidance

**Objective:** Deliver AI-driven guidance tailored to user health and product data through conversational interactions.

* Pass nutrition data to **`products` endpoint** (Nutriguide API).
* Combine health and product data for personalized analysis.
* Enable chatbot interaction via **`query` endpoint**:

  * Guide on protein, fat, sodium, etc.
  * Recommend serving sizes.
  * Suggest alternatives where applicable.
* Ensure **context awareness** across multiple queries.
* Provide summarized guidance reports.

### 5. User Interface (UI)

**Objective:** Build an intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive interface for product management, analysis, and chatbot interaction.

* Build a dashboard for:

  * Product management (add/remove)
  * Nutritional breakdown visualization
  * Health profile input
  * Chat interface for guidance
* Ensure chatbot has conversational memory per session.
* Add interactive graphs for nutrients and comparisons.
* Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop.

### 6. Optional Enhancements (Future Scope)

**Objective:** Expand the app’s ecosystem with advanced features for engagement, personalization, and scalability.

* User account creation and profile storage.
* Save previous chat sessions and nutritional analyses.
* Generate automated reports or meal plans.
* Recommend healthier substitutes automatically.
* Integration with wearable devices or health apps (long-term).
* Add gamification features (e.g., nutrition score, daily goals).
* Support multilingual chatbot interactions.

### 7. API Integration Workflow for the UI App

**Objective:** Leverage and combine the Smart Nutrition API and Nutriguide API endpoints to create a seamless interactive experience.

* **OCR-based Food Capture:**

  * Upload food product images through the UI.
  * Use OCR backend (**`product-name` endpoint**, Smart Nutrition API) to auto-fetch product names.
* **Nutritional Data Retrieval:**

  * Fetch nutrition facts using **`nutrition` endpoint** (Smart Nutrition API) for OCR-detected or manually entered products.
  * Store and display results in the UI.
* **User Health Profile:**

  * Collect health details/preferences and pass to **`health` endpoint** (Nutriguide API).
* **Personalized Guidance:**

  * Pass product nutrition data to **`products` endpoint** (Nutriguide API).
  * Use **`query` endpoint** to deliver AI-based recommendations.
  * Display chatbot conversation in the UI.
* **Interactive Product Management:**

  * Add/remove products → nutrition data refreshes → recommendations update in real time.
* **End-to-End Workflow Integration:**

  * Image upload → OCR detects product → Nutrition fetched → Health + Products processed → Chatbot guidance displayed.
